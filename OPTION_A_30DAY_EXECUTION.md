Risk: API-Frontend integration issues
Mitigation: Daily integration check-ins, early testing

Risk: Database migration problems
Mitigation: Test migrations in staging first, have rollback plan

Risk: Performance bottlenecks under load
Mitigation: Load testing on Days 7-9, optimize early

Risk: CORS/Security issues
Mitigation: Configure and test early, security audit

Risk: Data loss
Mitigation: Automated backups, test restore procedures
```

### Team Risks
```
Risk: Agent unavailability
Mitigation: Cross-training, backup agents on standby

Risk: Coordination issues
Mitigation: Strong PM (Agent 0), daily standups, Slack

Risk: Scope creep
Mitigation: Strict scope management, focus on MVP

Risk: Burnout
Mitigation: Realistic timelines, sustainable pace
```

### Business Risks
```
Risk: Stakeholder dissatisfaction
Mitigation: Regular demos, UAT involvement, clear communication

Risk: Launch delay
Mitigation: Buffer time built in, contingency plans

Risk: Budget overrun
Mitigation: 10% contingency, strict budget tracking
```
