## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Can we do it faster than 30 days?
**A:** Possible with more agents or higher risk. 20-25 days with 20 agents, but increases coordination complexity.

### Q: Can we do it cheaper?
**A:** Yes, but slower (60-90 days) with fewer agents or juniors. Quality may suffer.

### Q: What if we can't find all 15 agents?
**A:** Can proceed with 10-12 agents, extend timeline to 40-45 days.

### Q: What if something goes wrong?
**A:** We have rollback procedures, backup plans, and 10% contingency budget.

### Q: Can we launch with less features?
**A:** Yes, MVP approach: 60-70 core APIs in 15-20 days, launch incrementally.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A:** Team coordination and integration. Mitigated with Agent 0 (PM) and daily standups.
