## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM TODAY

### What We Discovered
1. **Backend is strong** - 67 routes, well-architected
2. **Frontend needs work** - Most components use mock data
3. **Scope is massive** - 597-786 hours of remaining work
4. **Critical modules missing** - Field Ops, Trade Marketing, Brand Mgmt
5. **Mobile is essential** - Offline-first app needed for field agents

### What We Fixed
1. ✅ Field Marketing Dashboard - now shows real data
2. ✅ Customer Selection - pulls from API
3. ✅ Brand Selection - pulls from API
4. ✅ Product Distribution - submits to API
5. ✅ GPS Verification - updates locations
6. ✅ Build system - compiles successfully

### What We Learned
- System is more like 12% complete (vs 67% initially thought)
- Most "completed" components were just UI shells with mock data
- Real production-ready state needs 600+ more hours of work
- Field Operations and Trade Marketing are make-or-break features
- Brand-level functionality is a critical differentiator
