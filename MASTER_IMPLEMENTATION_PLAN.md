- You have 100+ field agents
- You do retail execution
- You need trade marketing
- You want competitive advantage
- You have budget ($50k-100k)
- You have 6-12 months timeline

### Build vs Buy Analysis

**Build (Custom Development)**
- ✅ Fully customized

**Buy (SaaS Solutions)**
- ✅ Quick deployment
- ✅ No maintenance
- ✅ Regular updates
- ❌ Monthly fees ($50-200/user)
- ❌ Limited customization
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
