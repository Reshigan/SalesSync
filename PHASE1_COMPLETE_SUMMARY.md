## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Audit First** - Identified all problems before coding

3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Clear roadmap prevents confusion
4. **Multiple Deployment Methods** - Flexibility in deployment
5. **Automation** - Scripts speed up future deployments

### Pattern Established
For each remaining placeholder page:
1. Check backend API exists (or create it)

3. Modify for specific entity (users, customers, etc.)
4. Wire into router and sidebar
5. Build and test locally
6. Deploy to production
7. Verify all buttons work
8. Move to next page

**Estimated Time per Page:** 3-6 hours
